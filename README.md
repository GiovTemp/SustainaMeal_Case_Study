This repo is the used to store the all the data and notebooks of our project.

## Preprocessing.ipynb
This file contains the code used to preprocess the dataset of the recipes, introducing also the sustainability score and the sustainability labels, computed through the dataset of ingredients, builded from the CSEL dataset. For the sustainability labels, we split the range of the values in some beans and give them a specific label

## EDA_recipes_csv.ipynb
This file contains the code used to explore the dataset of the recipes

## Ingredient_dataset_generation.ipynb
This file contains the code used to build the dataset of ingredients, with the values of the carbon foot print and the water foot print, from the CSEL dataset

## Labeling_dataset.ipynb
This file contains the code to labels the healthiness score(who_score), so split the range of the values in some beans and give them a specific label
